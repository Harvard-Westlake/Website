    <p class="lyricsbox"> Here are some of Taylor's amazing lyrics:
      I walked through the door with you
      The air was cold
      But something about it felt like home somehow
      And I, left my scarf there at your sister's house
      And you've still got it in your drawer even now
      Oh, your sweet disposition
      And my wide-eyed gaze
      We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
      Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
      And I can picture it after all these days
      And I know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more
      And I might be okay but I'm not fine at all
      'Cause there we are again on that little town street
      You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
      Wind in my hair, I was there
      I remember it all too well
